        In the garden where the sun does shine, Stretching wide, the humble
        line, With whispering winds that dance and play, It holds the promise of
        a sunny day. Clothes like flags on a gentle breeze, Each color a song, a
        memory teased, Petticoats flutter, T-shirts spin, Captured in moments
        where sweet days begin. Whites so bright, like clouds up high, Denim
        blues that catch the eye, Every sock and every sheet, Telling tales of
        life so sweet. Sunlight kisses, raindrops greet, Natureâ€™s rhythm, a
        dance, a beat, As shadows weave in evening's glow, Each garment imbued
        with love's warm flow. Oh, washing line, so simple, true, A thread that
        binds me, and binds you, In every sway and every sway, Life's little
        moments, in bright array.
